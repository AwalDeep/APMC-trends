# APMC-trends
The objective is to understand trends in each APMC and commodity in the given dataset. 

This EDA was done as a task given by SocialCops team in the technical round.

Some of the outcomes were:

1.There were two datasets, both were analysed for basic usage.
2.Some of the features that were not useful were removed.
3.Almost 2300 entries were detected and filtered out as outliers.
4.CLusters were formed based on APMC and commodity. Large no. of clusters were formed and some of them were plotted for trends in prices.
5.Seasonlaity is there and most of the clusters fall into additive seasonality but there are some which contain multiplicative seasonality.
6. Bajri commodity was compared for APMC vs MSP.
7.The selling prices of Bajri in mandi are higher than the minimum support price given.
8.The MSP for BAJRI has risen with time but so has the mandi price but with more pace.    
9. More analysis in future to be done for different commodities and different APMC's respectively to detect trends in prices.
10.Other tasks related to seasonality to be performed.
